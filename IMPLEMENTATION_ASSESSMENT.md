## 🚀 Technical Achievements

### 1. Enhanced n8n API Client (Story 1.2) ✅
**File:** `src/n8n/enhanced-api.ts`

**Core Features Implemented:**
- ✅ **Intelligent Caching System**: TTL-based caching with data volatility awareness
- ✅ **Rate Limiting Protection**: 100ms minimum between requests
- ✅ **Response Sanitization**: Automatic removal of sensitive data (passwords, tokens, keys)  
- ✅ **Cache Management**: Statistics, invalidation patterns, memory efficiency
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Structured N8NMcpError integration with context
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Cache hit/miss tracking and response time optimization

**Cache Strategy:**
```typescript
workflows: 300,    // 5 minutes (moderate change frequency)
nodeTypes: 3600,   // 1 hour (rarely change)  
health: 30,        // 30 seconds (frequent updates)
executions: 0,     // No caching (always fresh)
```

### 3. New Intelligent Features ✅

**Intelligent Node Recommendations:**
```typescript
// Smart scoring system considers:
- Name/description matching (10 points)
- Provider preferences (5 points)  
- Complexity levels (1-3 points)
- Usage patterns and workflow context
```

**System Health Diagnostics:**
```typescript
// Comprehensive health monitoring:
- n8n API connectivity testing
- Environment variable validation
- Performance metrics collection
- Cache effectiveness monitoring
```

## 🏗️ Architecture & Integration

### Enhanced Response Format
All tools now return structured responses:
```typescript
{
  ...originalData,
  source: 'enhanced_api',
  timestamp: '2025-08-26T12:40:41.429Z',
  metadata: {
    // Operation-specific context
    cached: boolean,
    executionTime: number,
    operationType: string
  }
}
```

### Security Integration
- ✅ **Response Sanitization**: Removes passwords, API keys, tokens
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation for all parameters
- ✅ **Error Boundary**: Prevents sensitive information in error messages
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Protects against API quota exhaustion
