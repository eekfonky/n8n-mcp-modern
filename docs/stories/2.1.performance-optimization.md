# Story 2.1: Intelligent Caching and Performance Optimization

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Claude Code user,  
**I want** n8n MCP tools to respond extremely quickly with intelligent caching,  
**so that** my workflow automation tasks are efficient and don't interrupt my development flow.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Response Time Improvement**: Common operations (workflow lists, node search) under 500ms through intelligent caching
2. **Cache Intelligence**: Smart cache invalidation based on n8n workflow changes and user activity patterns
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Caching implementation uses minimal memory with configurable limits
4. **Cache Hit Optimization**: Frequently accessed data cached with appropriate TTL based on change frequency
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics collection and optimization feedback
6. **Graceful Cache Management**: Cache failures don't impact functionality - graceful fallback to API calls
7. **User-Configurable Performance**: Cache settings configurable via environment variables for different use cases

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Advanced Caching Architecture** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Implement intelligent cache with LRU eviction and memory limits
  - [ ] Add cache warming strategies for frequently accessed data

  - [ ] Add cache health monitoring and alerting

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Building on Epic 1's foundation, this story optimizes performance characteristics identified in the architecture analysis [Source: docs/architecture.md#performance-requirements].

**Performance Targets**:
- **Common Operations**: < 500ms (workflow lists, node search, health checks)
- **Complex Operations**: < 1 second (workflow creation, execution initiation)
- **Cache Hit Operations**: < 100ms
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB cache overhead

**Caching Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models-and-schema-changes]:
```typescript
interface CacheStrategy {
  workflows: { ttl: 300000, invalidateOn: ['workflow.updated', 'workflow.created'] }
  nodeTypes: { ttl: 3600000, invalidateOn: ['never'] }
  executions: { ttl: 60000, invalidateOn: ['execution.finished'] }
  systemHealth: { ttl: 30000, invalidateOn: ['always'] }
}
```

### Technical Implementation Details

**Enhanced Cache Architecture**:
```typescript
// Intelligent cache with multiple strategies
class IntelligentCache {
  private lruCache: LRUCache<string, CachedItem>
  private invalidationRules: Map<string, InvalidationRule[]>
  private performanceMetrics: PerformanceTracker
  
  async get<T>(key: string, fallback: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>
  async invalidate(pattern: string): Promise<void>
  getPerformanceStats(): CachePerformanceStats
}
```

**File Locations**:
```
src/n8n/
├── enhanced-api.ts           # Integrate cache usage
├── intelligent-cache.ts      # NEW: Advanced caching implementation
├── performance-monitor.ts    # NEW: Performance tracking
└── cache-config.ts          # NEW: Cache configuration management
```

### Performance Optimization Patterns

**Predictive Caching**:
```typescript
// Cache warming based on usage patterns
class CacheWarmer {
  async warmCommonData() {
    // Pre-cache frequently accessed workflows
    // Pre-cache node types on startup
    // Predict user needs based on recent activity
  }
}
```

**Smart Invalidation**:
```typescript
// Webhook-based cache invalidation
app.post('/webhook/n8n-changes', (req, res) => {
  const { event, workflowId } = req.body
  cache.invalidatePattern(`workflow:${workflowId}:*`)
  cache.invalidatePattern('workflows:list:*')
})
```

### Testing Requirements

**Performance Testing**:
- **Load Testing**: Simulate high-frequency tool usage
- **Cache Effectiveness**: Measure hit rates and response times
- **Memory Testing**: Validate memory usage stays within limits
- **Stress Testing**: Cache behavior under high load

**Test Implementation**:
```typescript
describe('Performance Optimization', () => {
  test('workflow listing under 500ms with cache', async () => {
    const start = Date.now()
    await mcpTool('get_n8n_workflows', { limit: 10 })
    const duration = Date.now() - start
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(500)
  })
  
  test('cache hit rates exceed 80% for common operations', async () => {
    // Execute multiple identical requests
    // Measure cache hit percentage
    expect(cacheHitRate).toBeGreaterThan(0.8)
  })
})
```
