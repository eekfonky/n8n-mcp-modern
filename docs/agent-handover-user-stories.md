### Story 3: Real-time Monitoring and Alerting System
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** to monitor API endpoints, analyze response times, send alerts based on thresholds, and generate reports  
**So that** I can proactively manage system health

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Monitors multiple endpoints continuously
- [ ] Alert thresholds are configurable and accurate
- [ ] Response time analysis identifies trends
- [ ] Reports are generated automatically and useful

**Expected Agent Flow:**
1. **n8n-workflow-architect** - Designs monitoring architecture and alert strategy
2. **n8n-developer-specialist** - Implements monitoring logic and basic alerting
3. **n8n-performance-specialist** - Optimizes monitoring efficiency and analysis algorithms
4. **n8n-guidance-specialist** - Creates documentation and user guides

**Handover Triggers:**
- Architecture approved → Implementation begins
- Performance monitoring needs optimization → Performance specialist required
- Complex setup requires documentation → Guidance specialist needed

## Handover Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Context Preservation
**Scenario:** Architect hands workflow plan to developer
**Validation:**
- [ ] Developer receives complete workflow architecture
- [ ] All design decisions and rationale are preserved
- [ ] Technical requirements are clearly documented
- [ ] Success criteria are understood

### Test 2: Bidirectional Handover  
**Scenario:** Performance specialist identifies code changes needed, hands back to developer
**Validation:**
- [ ] Developer receives specific optimization recommendations
- [ ] Performance metrics and targets are clear
- [ ] Original context is maintained throughout
- [ ] Changes can be validated by performance specialist

### Test 3: Emergency Escalation
**Scenario:** Developer discovers security vulnerability in custom JavaScript
**Validation:**
- [ ] JavaScript specialist receives immediate priority handover
- [ ] Security context and risk assessment are included
- [ ] Original workflow progress is preserved
- [ ] Remediation can continue seamlessly

### Test 4: Multi-hop Handover Chain
**Scenario:** Complex workflow requires architect → developer → integration → performance → guidance
**Validation:**
- [ ] Each agent receives complete context from previous agent
- [ ] No work is duplicated or lost
- [ ] Final outcome meets original user requirements
- [ ] User can follow progress through all phases

## Success Metrics

### Context Preservation Score
- **100%** - Complete context transfer, no information loss
- **90-99%** - Minor details lost, major context preserved
- **80-89%** - Some context loss, may require clarification
- **<80%** - Significant context loss, handover failed

### Handover Efficiency
- **Time to handover completion** - < 30 seconds for context transfer
- **Agent readiness** - Receiving agent can start immediately
- **Rollback capability** - Can return to previous agent if needed

### User Experience
- **Transparency** - User understands current agent and progress
- **Progress visibility** - Clear indication of workflow completion status
- **Agent expertise match** - Right specialist for each phase
- **Final outcome quality** - Meets or exceeds single-agent approach

## Feature Flags for Gradual Rollout

```typescript
export const HANDOVER_FLAGS = {
  enableHandovers: boolean,          // Master switch
  complexityThreshold: number,       // Auto-trigger based on workflow complexity
  allowUserDisable: boolean,         // Users can opt out
  emergencyEscalation: boolean,      // Priority handovers for critical issues
  bidirectionalHandovers: boolean,   // Allow back-and-forth between agents
  handoverMetrics: boolean,          // Track and report handover success
}
```

This allows gradual rollout and user choice between simple routing and collaborative agent approach.
