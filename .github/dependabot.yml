# 📝 Additional Dependabot Notes:
# 
# 1. **Security Updates**: Critical security updates will be created immediately
#    regardless of schedule, with high priority labels
#
# 2. **Automatic Merging**: PRs from dependabot for patch/minor updates to 
#    non-critical dependencies can be auto-merged if CI passes
#
# 3. **Manual Review Required**: Major version updates and core dependency 
#    changes require manual review and testing
#
# 4. **Branch Strategy**: All dependabot PRs target 'develop' branch to ensure
#    proper testing before merging to 'main'
#
# 5. **Rate Limiting**: Open PR limits prevent overwhelming the review process
#    while ensuring steady progress on dependency updates
#
# 6. **Intelligent Grouping**: Related dependencies are updated together to
#    minimize conflicts and improve testing efficiency
#
# 7. **Time Zones**: All schedules use UTC to ensure consistent timing
#    regardless of maintainer location
